## Abstract
Project Name: FoxEats

Project Purpose: Creating a database & platform for students to order food from the different options on-campus and get it delivered, similar to the 'MobileOrder' app that we already have on-campus. The page will have a login & password checked by FoxID to make sure it is the correct user. We will also have the user's building to know where the food will be delivered, as well as contact numbers for any troubles with the orders. Each eatery will have different food options with their own prices, descriptions, and ratings. We will have a status if the eatery is open, as well as updates whether or not the food is ready, delivered, or in the process of being made.

Project Target: Students will be using our platform, as well as dining services to communicate with the students for any problems with the orders.

Data to be used: FoxID, Username, Password, Contact_Number, Building, Eateries, Food_Options, Prices, Food_Description, Rating, Status, Update

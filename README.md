## Abstract
Project Name: FoxEats

Project Purpose: Creating a database & platform for students to order food from the different options on-campus and get it delivered, similar to the 'MobileOrder' app that we already have on-campus. The page will have a login & password checked by FoxID to make sure it is the correct user.

Project Target: Students will be using our platform, as well as dining services to communicate with the students for any problems with the orders.

Data to be used: FoxID, Username, Password, Contact_Number, Building, Eateries, Food_Options, Prices, Food_Description, Rating, Status(Is the eatery open?), Update(Ordered, Making order, Out for delivery, delivered)

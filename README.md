## Abstract
Project Name: FoxEats

Project Purpose: Creating a database & platform for students to order food from the different options on-campus and get it delivered, similar to the 'MobileOrder' app that we already have on-campus. This is also similar to how UberEats or Grubhub operates. The page will have a login & password checked by FoxID to make sure it is the correct user. We will also have the user's building to know where the food will be delivered, as well as contact numbers for any troubles with the orders. Each dining service will have different food options with their own prices, descriptions, and ratings. We will have a status if the dining service is open, as well as updates whether or not the food is ready, delivered, or in the process of being made.

Target User: Students will be using our platform, as well as dining services to communicate with the students for any problems with the orders. We want our platform to be descriptive for the user and streamline the delivery process.

Data to be used: FoxID, Credit_Card, Balance, Username, Password, Contact_Number, Building, Dining_Service, Food_Category, Food_Option, Price, Food_Description, Rating, Status, Update, Order_ID, Order_History

Data Collection: We will gather the data from current dining service options, as well as statistics, and sort of base our app from the 'MobileOrder' framework.

Output Design: We currently do not have a design ready in mind, but we know we will have a login page, dining services page, cart page, a payment page that shows a confirmation screen, and finalizes a receipt with all the information required.
